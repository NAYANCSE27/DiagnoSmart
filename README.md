# DiagnoSmart

**Data Collection:**

Collect data on symptoms, medical history, and other relevant factors for patients diagnosed with different diseases. This data can be collected through various sources such as electronic health records (EHR), patient surveys, or other medical records. We have collect our data from the mention sources:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndasilva/diabetes
3. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset


**Data Preprocessing:**

Process the collected data to clean and transform it into a suitable format for the model. This can include tasks such as:
1. Data cleaning 
2. Normalization 
3. Feature extraction
4. Feature selection.


**Feature Engineering:**

Identify relevant features from the preprocessed data that could help in predicting diseases. This can be done using techniques such as:
1. correlation analysis
2. Principal component analysis (PCA)
3. Other feature selection algorithms.


**Model Building:**

Build a machine learning model using the preprocessed and engineered features. There are several models that could be used for this, such as: 
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Neural Networks
6. Convolutional Neural Network.


**Model Training:**

Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data. Split the data into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data.


**Model Evaluation:**

Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to evaluate the model's performance.


**Hyperparameter Tuning:**

Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance on the validation set. This can be done using techniques such as:
1. Grid Search
2. Random Search
3. Bayesian Optimization.


**Model Deployment:**

Deploy the trained model into a production environment. This can be done using various technologies such as
1. Flask
2. Django
3. RESTful APIs.


**User Interface:**

Create a user interface that allows users to input their symptoms and medical history, and receive predictions for their likelihood of having a particular disease. This can be done using libraries such as streamlit, Tkinter or PyQt.


**Testing and Maintenance:**

Test the system thoroughly and maintain it by updating the model and user interface as new data and features become available.

Overall, the project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict multiple diseases based on patient symptoms and medical history. The model is trained on a large dataset of patients diagnosed with various diseases and is evaluated on new, unseen data. The model is then deployed into a production environment, where users can input their symptoms and medical history to receive predictions for their likelihood of having a particular disease.
